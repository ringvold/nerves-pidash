# nerves-pidash

Port of pidash (https://github.com/ringvold/pidash= to Phoenix from Go. This will use Nerves (nerves-project.org)
to build a firmware to boot on Raspberry Pi 3 (https://github.com/LeToteTeam/kiosk_system_rpi3).

## Why?
Basically because Nerves. Its awesome and I have wanted to try Elixir for a while.
